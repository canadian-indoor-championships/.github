The event returns to Montreal again next year, for the 2025 Canadian Indoor Track & Field Championships.

Canada’s first Olympic city Montreal plays host for the first National Championships of this Olympic and Paralympic year.

Complexe sportif Claude-Robillard has seen plenty of Canadian track & field history over the years, both indoors and outdoors, and this storied athletics venue will see hundreds of Canada’s top U16, U18, U20, and Senior athletes chase that coveted title: National Champion.

“Athletes from all 13 provinces and territories will have the opportunity to perform on the track at the famous Complexe sportif Claude-Robillard, built for the 1976 Olympic Games in Montreal. There is so much history in this building, which remains a very high-level training site to this day, and a competition venue where multiple Olympians have competed,” said Vainqueurs Plus president Danielle Boulanger.

With so many Canadian athletes, coaches and officials descending on Montreal this March, organizers are putting together a first-class event.

“Athletes, get ready for a spectacular event! Above all, think big, because everyone is allowed to dream and reach the highest peaks,” Boulanger said. “Coaches, everything will be in place for your athletes to perform up to their ambitions! All that remains is to get your hands dirty and work hard in training until then! Officials, Club Vainqueurs Plus knows how to take care of the officials, who play such an important role in the world of athletics!”
